    <p>
      The science of constructing machines, or a computer program, which demonstrate intelligent behavior dates back to the 1950s and is known as Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
      Over the past few years it has experienced rebirth through big data, high-powered GPUs and new algorithms. 
      AI is blooming today in almost every industry. 
      In general, the global AI market is estimated in the billions of dollars; as an example, generative AI spending was roughly $365b in 2024, and it is expected to reach 644b in 2025. 
      The largest of this investment is cloud infrastructure and AI services, though software tools and applications are growing by leaps and bounds. 
      Surveys conclude that around 77 percent of the companies are already using AI or considering it, and 83 percent declare that AI is a priority in their business plans.

<p class="ai-description">
  The idea of AI imagery is everywhere - current AI is driving robotics, autonomous systems and digital assistants.
  The most significant is generative AI (large language and vision models): systems, such as GPT-4 from OpenAI, Bard from Google and image generators (Stable Diffusion, DALL E), enable computers to generate text, code or art based on a prompt.
  They are utilized in customer service (chatbots), making content, and software engineering, such as GPT-like AI being implemented in the Office suite by Microsoft.
  But businesses have discovered that developing their own AI models is expensive and hence the option to use ready-made AI services.
  Gartner predicts that in 2024 80 percent of all AI expenditures were on hardware (GPUs) and expenditure on AI software would very nearly double in 2025.
  In brief, the AI sector is at a hyper-growth stage both practically and hypothetically.

    <h1>There are concrete use cases for how AI is changing particular industries</h1>
    <h2>Healthcare and Life Sciences</h2>
    <p>AI can help with drug discovery, personalized medicine, and diagnostics (such as tumor identification using images).
    <p>One milestone is that of DeepMind with the Alphafold2, which has predicted the 3D structure of ~200 million proteins, which is basically all proteins known to science. 
       The breakthrough (which received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024) takes less time to research drugs and learn more biology. 
       AI is used in X-ray and MRI interpretation, as hospitals do this; GE Healthcare, also in March 2024, announced that it is using accelerated artificial intelligence computing to make ultrasound imaging, faster and more accurate. 
       Another growing area is remote patient monitoring using artificial intelligence analysis (echoing wearable devices on IoT).</p>

The image conveys a scientific and analytical tone, representing advances in computational biology.">

    <h2>Production and Industry</h2>
    <p>  AI is a part of Industry 4.0.
         Predictive maintenance has been long used by IBM.
         IBM employs predictive maintenance by integrating edge computing, AI (particularly machine learning), IoT sensors, and its cloud-based analytics to track equipment and anticipate failures before they happen. 
         This helps businesses prolong asset life, lower maintenance costs, and prevent downtime.

  </div>

<div class="ai-image3">
<h2>Finance and Banking:</h2>
    <p> In a lot of finance, AI algorithms are being used where they determine high-frequency trading or credit scoring. 
        Machine learning is applied in the detection of fraudulent transactions by banks, and Artificial intelligence is used to provide services to fund portfolios by the so-called robo-advisors. 
        Morgan Stanley utilizes AI to analyze the market, and a huge number of insurance companies utilize AI in order to automate claims. There is also the use of conversational AI (e.g. chatbots to customer service). 
        Remarkably, AI is becoming common in regulatory compliances and risk modelling in the banking sector.

  </div>


<div class="ai-image4">
<h2>Retail and E-Commerce: </h2>
    <p> Retailers online have adopted AI in recommending products, targeted marketing and inventories. 
        Robots (with assistance of AI) automate the process of warehouse automation (e.g. warehouses of Amazon). 
        Checkout-free shopping is carried out with the help of AI-powered cameras and sensors at physical stores. 
        An example is that Amazon Go stores have adopted computer vision to enable customers to walk out of the retail shop without necessarily doing a manual scan. 
        Artificial intelligence is an AI demand forecasting that can assist retailers with stocking the correct products.
