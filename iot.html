        <p>
          Developed towards the end of 1990s and the beginning of 2000s, in recent years IoT has taken off: estimated by the end-2024 there will be 18.8 billion connected IoT devices globally (compared to 2023 it means increase by ~13%). 
          Asset Internet of Things investments also took an increase of ~10% in 2024 to approximately 298 billion dollars. Such devices produce enormous volumes of data: one estimate suggests ~110 exabytes of cellular IoT data by 2028, with the bulk of this data being automotive (18.6 EB in 2023 to 59.4 EB by 2028) and followed by the logistics, industrial and healthcare sectors. 
          The majority of companies record a positive return on investment by IoT—the field of enterprise that recorded a positive, about 92% of all inquired enterprises claim that IoT projects have yielded positive returns. Global use cases also increased by around 53% between the years 2021 and 2024.

  <h2>IoT in Action</h2>
    <p>
        IoT is revolutionizing industries by connecting devices and enabling data-driven decisions. From smart homes to industrial automation, IoT enhances efficiency and innovation.
        Consumer IoT is becoming the norm, with connected fragrance dispensers being sold in retail stores. IoT is being used in urban areas to create "smart city" installations, where city control centers are fed data from parking sensors, traffic cameras, smart meters, and pollution monitors. 
        Even regular customers take part, as evidenced by the connection of smart home devices like lighting, security cameras, and thermostats to IoT hubs.
        IoT is a pillar of Industry 4.0, allowing predictive maintenance and automation in production processes. 
        Companies like Siemens and Bosch use IoT sensors to monitor vibrations and temperatures, enabling them to identify faults before equipment breaks down and plan maintenance procedures.
        IoT is also transforming healthcare with remote patient monitoring and smart medical devices, improving patient care and reducing costs. In agriculture, IoT sensors optimize irrigation and crop management, increasing yields and sustainability.

  <h1>Industries Transformed by IoT</h1>
  <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet of Things is reshaping industries worldwide. In manufacturing, IoT enables predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring, reducing downtime and costs. 
    Automated quality control (machine-vision inspection) and predictive maintenance (downtime reduction) are made possible by machine sensors.
    Intel makes manufacturing "smart" by making it possible for:

    Edge computing devices use Intel® CoreTM, AtomTM, and Xeon® processors to process data close to the source, such as on a factory floor.
    Computer vision systems that use edge AI to identify flaws or safety infractions.
    AI and sensor-powered predictive maintenance to cut down on downtime. For instance, Intel-powered gateways are used to assess machine temperatures and vibrations locally in order to forecast breakdowns.

<div class="iot-industries2">
<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>
    Healthcare: Wearables, remote monitors, and smart hospital beds are examples of connected medical gadgets that provide ongoing patient monitoring. 
    IoT was utilized for patient tracking and contact tracing during COVID-19 (e.g. Telenor’s SafeTrx for social distancing). 
    Businesses that rely on large amounts of patient data, such as GE Healthcare, also highlight AI-enabled diagnostics (accelerated processing for ultrasound scans).

</div>


<div class="iot-industries3">
<h2>Agriculture</h2>
<p>
    "Precision farming" is made possible by IoT sensors for crop health, weather, and soil moisture, as well as drones for imaging. 
    AI examines patterns to predict yields or disease outbreaks, and sensor data can be used to automate weeding and irrigation.

<div class="iot-industries4">
<h2>Transportation & Automotive: </h2>
<p>
    IoT platforms are found in modern automobiles. Automakers collect telemetry data for diagnostic purposes and distribute firmware updates over the air. 
    By 2028, automotive IoT data flow is expected to triple, according to the Telenor analysis, allowing for new services (such as usage-based insurance and in-car infotainment) and features like fleet predictive maintenance.
